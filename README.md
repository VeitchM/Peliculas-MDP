# Peliculas Mar del plata

An app created with React which shows the movies available in Mar del Plata, with its schedules and cinemas
Now the api used for getting the schedules is down, for this reason it won't update, it will load the file created with the last connection to the API

# Use it

You can use it from the web page
[Railway](https://peliculas-mdp-production.up.railway.app/)
